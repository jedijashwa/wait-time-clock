Wait-Time Clock
 
## Heading ##
Wait-Time Clock

## Sub-Heading ##
For people who use a wait time that is constantly changing and want to be able to share that wait time.

## Summary ##
This web app displays a clock for a current eta using a given wait time. The wait time is editable. When being viewed from different clients, the wait time will be up to date and the same on all of them.

## Problem ##
Communicating how long of a wait things will have to an entire team takes time away from the tasks that are causing that wait, increasing the wait time with each time it is shared.

## Solution ##
A clock with the wait time that is visable to an entire team means that telling the team what the wait time is takes the exact same amount of time regardless of the team size.

## Quote from You ##
"Every time you ask how long it is going to be, know it's going to be longer."

## How to Get Started ##
To get set up all you need to do is create an acount and go to the wait time clock's page.
